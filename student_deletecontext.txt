Delete Context Tool for Student

A precise tool for removing elements from your educational knowledge graph.
This tool enables targeted deletion of academic entities, relationships between educational components, or specific observations about study materials.
It helps maintain an accurate and current representation of your academic landscape as your learning journey evolves.

When to use this tool:
- Removing completed or dropped courses
- Deleting obsolete relationships between academic entities
- Pruning outdated notes or observations that are no longer relevant
- Correcting errors in your academic knowledge graph
- Cleaning up test or practice entities
- Maintaining graph accuracy as your educational focus changes
- Removing duplicate learning materials or resources
- Archiving completed assignments or exams

Key features:
- Three distinct deletion operation types (entities, relations, observations)
- Cascading deletion for entities (automatically removes related relations)
- Precise deletion of specific observations without removing entire entities
- Targeted relation removal with exact matching on from/to/type
- Batch operations for efficient cleanup
- JSON-formatted response with operation results
- Secure validation before deletion
- Clear error messages when operations fail

Parameters explained:
- type: The deletion operation type to perform, which must be one of:
  * "entities" - Remove academic entities and their relations
  * "relations" - Remove specific relationships between entities
  * "observations" - Remove specific observations from entities
- data: Operation-specific data structure:
  * For "entities": Array of entity names to delete
  * For "relations": Array of objects with { from, to, relationType }
  * For "observations": Array of objects with { entityName, observations[] }

Deletion behavior by type:
- "entities": Completely removes the specified entities and any relations where they appear
- "relations": Removes only the exact relations specified, matching on all three attributes
- "observations": Removes specific observations from entities while preserving the entities themselves

Safety considerations:
- Entity deletion cascades to relations, so be careful when deleting key entities
- There is no "undo" operation, so confirm deletions carefully
- Partial graph information can lead to inconsistent views of your academic knowledge
- Relations require entities on both ends to exist

You should:
1. Identify the specific elements in your academic graph that need to be removed
2. Choose the appropriate deletion type (entities, relations, or observations)
3. Structure your data according to the deletion type's requirements
4. Start with more specific deletions (observations) before broader ones
5. Verify the entities or relations exist before attempting deletion
6. Check the operation result to confirm successful deletion
7. Consider documenting major deletions as observations on related entities
8. When removing an entire course, first delete its components for cleaner removal
