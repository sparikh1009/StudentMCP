A flexible tool for constructing and enhancing your educational knowledge graph.
This tool allows you to add new academic entities, create relationships between educational components, or add observations to existing study materials.
Each operation type serves a specific purpose in building a comprehensive representation of your academic journey.

When to use this tool:
- Creating new educational entities like courses, assignments, and exams
- Establishing relationships between academic entities (e.g., assignment is part of a course)
- Documenting observations about your academic materials
- Building a connected graph of your educational experience
- Organizing your study resources and materials
- Tracking relationships between concepts and learning materials
- Recording course-specific details like schedules and due dates
- Creating structured representations of your academic knowledge

Key features:
- Three distinct operation types (entities, relations, observations)
- Type validation against academic domain standards
- Automatic rejection of invalid entity or relation types
- Safe addition of new observations to existing academic entities
- JSON-formatted response with operation results
- Clear error messages when operations fail
- Handles both single and batch operations

Parameters explained:
- type: The operation type to perform, which must be one of:
  * "entities" - Create new academic entities
  * "relations" - Create relationships between existing entities
  * "observations" - Add observations to existing entities
- data: Operation-specific data structure:
  * For "entities": Array of objects with { name, entityType, observations[] }
  * For "relations": Array of objects with { from, to, relationType }
  * For "observations": Array of objects with { entityName, contents[] }

Entity Types:
- course - Academic courses you're taking
- assignment - Homework, projects, and other submitted work
- exam - Tests, quizzes, and other assessments
- concept - Knowledge topics and learning objectives
- resource - Textbooks, articles, videos, and other learning materials
- note - Personal study notes and observations
- lecture - Individual class sessions
- project - Larger educational projects
- question - Specific questions for study or review
- term - Academic terms or semesters
- goal - Learning objectives and targets
- professor - Course instructors and teachers

Relation Types include:
- enrolled_in - Student is taking a course
- assigned_in - Assignment is part of a course
- due_on - Assignment/exam has specific due date
- covers - Lecture/resource covers concept
- references - Note references concept
- prerequisite_for - Concept is foundation for another
- taught_by - Course taught by professor
- scheduled_for - Lecture/exam scheduled for specific time
- contains - Course contains lectures/assignments

You should:
1. Specify the operation type based on what you need to create (entities, relations, or observations)
2. Structure your data according to the operation type's requirements
3. Use valid entity types and relation types from the academic domain
4. Ensure entities exist before creating relations between them
5. Provide meaningful names and descriptions for new entities
6. Use observations to add metadata like status, deadlines, or difficulty levels
7. Create complete structures rather than adding entities/relations piecemeal
8. Check the operation result to confirm successful creation
