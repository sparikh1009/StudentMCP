2. This session can be referenced when loading course context with loadcontext
3. Session activities are tracked for later recording
4. Sessions should be ended with endsession to record learning progress
5. Session history becomes available for future startsession calls

Status and Priority:
- Course status is retrieved through has_status relations (not_started, in_progress, complete)
- Assignment priority is retrieved through has_priority relations (low, high)
- This information helps you prioritize your study activities

You should:
1. Begin each focused study period with startsession
2. Review the provided context to determine your study focus
3. Prioritize high-priority assignments with upcoming deadlines
4. Focus on incomplete assignments (not_started or in_progress status)
5. Choose a specific course, assignment, or concept to work on
6. Use the generated session ID with the loadcontext tool to load specific entities
7. Complete your study work on your selected focus area
8. End the session with endsession when work is complete
9. Record concepts learned, assignment status updates, and study accomplishments
10. Use the session history to maintain continuity between study periods
